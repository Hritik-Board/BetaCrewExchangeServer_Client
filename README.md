Please note that you will need to have Node.js v6.0.0 or above. Will recommend to try on the most recent version to avoid any issues incase.

**We have already provided the whole node module in the folder, will suggest to directly copy into your local amchine**

Please run the below mentioned commands for the environment setup.

<br>
---- OPTIONAL STEP ----- 
<br>
Navigate to the directory where main.js is located and install any required dependencies:

- npm install

<br>
---- MANDATORY STEPS ----- 
<br>

Running the Server and Client
<br>
**Start the Server**

- node main.js

**Run the Client**

In another terminal, navigate to the directory where the client script is located and run:

- node client.js
  <br>

This script will connect to the server on port 3000, request all packets, and handle any missing sequences by requesting them specifically.
