Please note that you will need to have Node.js v6.0.0 or above. Will recommend to try on the most recent version to avoid any issues incase.

Please run the below mentioned commands for the environment setup.

Navigate to the directory where main.js is located and install any required dependencies:

npm install

Running the Server and Client
Start the Server

- node main.js

Run the Client

In another terminal, navigate to the directory where the client script is located and run:

- node client.js
  This script will connect to the server on port 3000, request all packets, and handle any missing sequences by requesting them specifically.
